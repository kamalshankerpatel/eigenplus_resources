# Author guidelines for blog posts
We aim to make complex concepts in computational mechanics accessible and engaging for our readers. We encourage our authors to use analogies and storytelling techniques to achieve this.

Remember,

> No one comes to the internet to read your blog; they come to find solutions to their problems. 

## Structure
1. **Introduction with Analogy and Hand-Drawn Image**
    - Begin with a relatable analogy using nearby objects from your house.
    - Form a story around this analogy to introduce the hard concept in computational mechanics.
    - Include a hand-drawn image to support your analogy visually.
    *Example:* If you are explaining stress distribution, you might compare it to how pressure is distributed when sitting on a soft couch. Draw a simple sketch of the couch with pressure points.

2. **Scientific Explanation**
    - Transition from the analogy to the actual science behind it.
    - Provide a clear and concise explanation of the concept of computational mechanics.
    - Use simple language and avoid jargon as much as possible.
    *Example:* Explain how stress distribution works in materials, relating it to the couch analogy.

3. **Key Learnings**
    - Summarize the main points of the blog post.
    - Highlight the key takeaways for the readers.
    - Ensure that these points are easy to understand and remember.
    *Example:* List the key principles of stress distribution and its importance in engineering.

## Writing Tips
- **Engage Your Readers:** Use a conversational tone to make your writing more engaging.
- **Be Clear and Concise:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Aim for clarity in your explanations.
- **Use Visuals:** Besides the hand-drawn image in the introduction, consider using other visual aids such as charts, graphs, or diagrams to help explain your points.
- **Use H2 Headings and Questions:** Structure your blog with H2 headings and phrase them as questions to guide the reader's curiosity and engagement.

## Submission Requirements
- **Length:** Aim for 800-1200 words.
- **Images:** Include at least one hand-drawn image in the introduction. Additional images should be high-quality and relevant. ==Images downloaded from the internet are not allowed.==
- **References:** Cite any sources or references used in your explanation.
- **Proofreading:** Ensure your post is free of grammatical and spelling errors.

## Conclusion
Following these guidelines will help make complex topics in computational mechanics more understandable and enjoyable for our readers. We look forward to your creative and insightful contributions!
